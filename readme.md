#### AnonPaste Readme

AnonPaste is an open-source website similar to Pastebin where you can store any piece of code, and generate links for easy sharing

However, what makes NoPaste special is that it works with **no database**, and **no back-end code**. Instead, the data is compressed and **stored entirely in the link** that you share, nowhere else!
